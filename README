Vim plugin for using Rebar commands conveniently inside Vim.

Currently only compile inside a \"simple\" (no sub_dirs) project works with the compiler window hooked up to compilation error messages.  Also has Rebar submenu plugin for NERDTree.

Next up:
* full implementation of create rebar subcommand with prompts and template autocomplete.
* align Erlang compilation error messages in sub_dir projects of root project as links in compiler error window.
* more coming soon...
